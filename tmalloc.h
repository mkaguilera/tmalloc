/*
   Each thread keeps its own pool of memory. To allocate a buffer,
   a thread gets memory from its pool.  If the same thread who
   allocated the buffer later frees the buffer, the buffer is returned
   to the local pool. If, however, a different thread frees the
   buffer, the buffer should not be returned to the thread's local
   pool, otherwise memory from one thread's pool starts to move to
   another thread's pool. In some applications where some threads
   allocate and produce data while others consume a free data, this
   would be a problem as memory would continually flow from one thread
   to another, eventually exhausting the pool of the first thread.
  
   To address this problem, if a thread frees a buffer allocated by
   another thread, it will send back the buffer to the other thread so
   that the other thread can return the buffer to its local pool. To
   send back buffers efficiently, a thread accumulates a bunch of
   buffers into a superbuffer of buffers, and once the superbuffer is
   large enough, it sends the entire superbuffer. The reason for doing
   this is to avoid too much thread synchronization.
  
   When a thread allocates memory, it checks to see if any
   superbuffers are being returned to it. If so, it returns all the
   buffers in the superbuffers to the local pool.
  
   To send superbuffers between threads, there is a concurrent linked
   list per thread.  The list stores the superbuffers to be received
   by the thread. Another thread adds a superbuffer to the link list
   of the first thread by create a new node pointing to the current
   hand, and then doing a compare-and-swap on the current head to
   change it to the new head. If the compare-and-swap fails, someone
   else managed to modify the head, so the process is repeated. The
   thread will consume the superbuffers in the link list, skipping the
   first entry. Doing so allows the thread to consume the superbuffers
   without changing the head pointer, and hence without contending
   with threads trying to add new elements. The side effect of this is
   that the superbuffer at the head will be consumed only after a new
   superbuffer is added.
  
   The local pool is itself a set of subpools, where each subpool
   keeps buffers of a fixed size. The sizes of the subpools grow
   exponentially. A new buffer is allocated from the subpool holding
   the smallest buffers that will fit the requested size.
